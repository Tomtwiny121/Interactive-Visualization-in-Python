# Interactive Visualization in Python

**© ExploreAI Academy**

In this training, we will focus on creating unique and interactive visualizations. We will learn how to make our code block outputs interactive for the end user.

⚠️ **Note:** An active internet connection is needed to complete the exercises within this notebook.

⚠️ **Note:** This exercise works best when executed in a Jupyter notebook.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this training, you should be able to:

- Create advanced custom visualizations in Python.
- Create interactive visualizations in a Jupyter notebook.

## Introduction

Sometimes we require interaction in our Jupyter notebooks rather than a PowerBI dashboard. A potential reason would be to employ more sophisticated technology to meet typical business intelligence use cases. Traditional BI tools are ideal for creating dashboards created from SQL or CSV data. However, when we try to display information created by more sophisticated logic, we often fall short.

With interactive widgets in a notebook, we can leverage the full power of Python to express calculations and build visualizations while exposing "our logic" to the end user, allowing them to modify aspects of the visualization. We may either add a few interactive controls and plots to notebooks or build completely functional applications and interactive dashboards. Both can be created with components from the built-in core widgets, such as buttons, sliders, and dropdowns, or with the rich ecosystem of custom widget libraries based on the Jupyter widgets framework, such as interactive maps with ipyleaflet or 2-D plots with bqplot.
